### Hello!

I sometimes/rarely _(pick one)_ use GitHub for stuff coding-related.

As you can see from my username, I am _The_ Coder (note the capitals). Ignore the "typo" which replaces `Coder` with `Cod-r` :)

By the way, what's the point of having bios if we have _this_?

My bio, which I haven't changed **at all** since like late 2020, reads as following:
> Hello! I am a human. Scientifically, I have a daily habit of consuming dihydrogen oxide and oxygen oxide (yes). I can create horrible websites and programs!

Everything said above is true, even 2Â½ years later. Wow!
